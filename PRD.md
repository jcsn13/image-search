1. **Image Upload System**
   - Cloud Storage-based image upload
   - Automatic processing trigger via Cloud Functions
   
2. **Image Analysis**
   - Gemini-powered image analysis
   - Generation of textual descriptions
   - Object and visual characteristic detection
   
3. **Vector Processing**
   - Multimodal embedding generation
   - Vector storage in Vertex AI Matching Engine
   
4. **Infrastructure**
   - Terraform-managed deployment
   - Comprehensive IAM roles and permissions
   - Event-driven architecture
